              for the same shortName module and that all modulefiles pass the syntax test.              
   (8.4.4)  * Fix bug in MasterControl:userInGroups(): capture returns string and status and
              tonumber() doesn't like it.

	    * Show extensions from hidden modules when doing (module --show_hidden avail)
	    * Add option (--nx, --no_extensions) to not print extensions when doing "ml avail".

   (8.4.17) * If python exists on system use $PYTHON -mjson.tool on the generation of *.json files from
              update_lmod_system_spider_cache_files script.  Note $PYTHON is found by looking for
	      python3, python or python2
	    * added TCL module function require-fullname to match requireFullName in Lua.
            * Do not check $cache_type twice, use $ext = lua for lua like operations in update

              Both --with-lua= and --with-luac= must be specified if one is specified
