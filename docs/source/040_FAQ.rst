Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How does the module command work?

   We know that the child program inherits the  parents' environment
   but not the other way around. So it is very surprising that a
   command can change the current shell's environment. The trick here
   is that the module command is a two part process.  The module shell
   function in bash is::

        $ type module
        module() { eval $($LMOD_CMD bash "$@") }

   Where $LMOD_CMD points to your lmod command (say
   /apps/lmod/lmod/libexec/lmod).  So if you have a module file
   (foo/1.0) that contains::

       setenv("FOO", "BAR")

   then "$LMOD_CMD bash load foo/1.0" the following string written to stdout::

       export FOO=BAR
       ...

   The eval command read that output from stdout and changes the
   current shell's environment. Any text written to stderr bypasses
   the eval and written to the terminal.

What are the environment variables _ModuleTable001_, _ModuleTable002_,
etc doing it in the environment?

    The module command remembers its state in the environment through
    these variables.  The way Lmod does it is through a Lua table called
    ModuleTable::

       ModuleTable = {
          mT = {
            git = { ... }
          }
       }

    This table contains quotes and commas and must be store in
    environment.  To prevent problems the various shells, the table is
    encoded into base64 and split into blocks of 256 characters.
    These variable are decoded at the start of Lmod.  You can see what
    the module table contains with::

        $ module --mt

How does one debug a modulefile?

    There are two methods.  Method 1: If you are writing a Lua modulefile then
    you can write messages to stderr with and run the module command normally::

        local a = "text"
        io.stderr:write("Message ",a,"\n")

    Method 2: Take the output directly from Lmod.  You can put print()
    statements in your modulefile and do::

        $ $LMOD_CMD bash load *modulefile*

Why doesn't  % ``module avail |& grep ucc``  work under tcsh and works under bash?

    It is a bug in the way tcsh handles evals. This works::

       % (module avail) |& grep ucc

    However, in all shells it is better to use::

       % module avail ucc

    instead as this will only output modules that have "ucc" in
    their name.


Can I disable the pager output?

   Yes, you can.  Just set the environment variable ``LMOD_PAGER`` to
   **none**.

Why are messages printed to standard error and not standard out?

    The module command is an alias under tcsh and a shell routine under
    all other shells. There is an lmod command which writes out commands
    such as export FOO="bar and baz" and messages are written to standard
    error. The text written to standard out is evaluated so that the text
    strings make changes to the current environment. See next question
    for a different way to handle Lmod messages.


Can I force the output of list, avail and spider to go to stdout
instead of stderr?

   Bash and Zsh user can set the environment variable
   ``LMOD_REDIRECT`` to **yes**.  Sites can configure Lmod to work
   this way by default.  However, no matter how Lmod is set-up,
   this will not work with tcsh/csh due to limitations of
   this shell.

How can I use grep easily with the module command?

   If your site doesn't send the output of stdout, you can still use
   this trick when you need to grep the output of module command.
   Here are some examples::

      $ module -t --redirect avail       | grep foo
      $ module --raw --redirect show foo | grep bar
      $ module -t --redirect spider      | grep baz

Can I ignore the spider cache files when doing ``module avail``?

   Yes you can::

      $ module --ignore_cache avail

   or you can set::

      $ export LMOD_IGNORE_CACHE=1

   to make Lmod ignore caches as long as the variable is set.

I have created a module and "module avail" can't find it. What do I
do?

   Assuming that the modulefile is in MODULEPATH then you have an
   out-of-date cache.  Try running::

      $ module --ignore_cache avail

   If this does find it then you might have an old personal spider cache.
   To clear it do::

      $ rm -rf ~/.lmod.d/.cache

   If "module avail" doesn't find it now, then the system spider cache
   is out-of-date.  Please ask your system administrator to update the
   cache.  If you are the system administrator then please read
   :ref:`system-spider-cache-label` and :ref:`user-spider-cache-label`

Why doesn't the module command work in shell scripts?

 It will if the following steps are taken. First the script must be a
 bash script and not a shell script, so start the script with
 ``#!/bin/bash``. The second is that the environment variable BASH_ENV
 must point to a file which defines the module command. The simplest
 way is having ``BASH_ENV`` point to ``/opt/apps/lmod/lmod/init/bash`` or
 wherever this file is located on your system. This is done by the
 standard install.  Finally Lmod exports the module command for Bash
 shell users.

How do I use the initializing shell script that comes with this application with Lmod?

 The short answer is you don't. Among the many problems is that there
 is no way to unload that shell script. If the script is simple you
 can read it through and create a modulefile. To simplify this task,
 Lmod provides the ``sh_to_modulefile`` script to convert shell
 scripts to modulefiles. See :ref:`sh_to_modulefile-label` for more details.

Why is the output of ``module avail`` not filling the width of the terminal?

  If the output of ``module avail`` is 80 characters wide, then Lmod
  can't find the width of the terminal and instead uses the default
  size (80). If you do ``module --config``, you'll see a line:

      Active lua-term                true

  If it says **false** instead then lua-term is not installed.  One
  way this happens is to build Lmod on one computer system that has a
  system lua-term installed and the package on another where lua-term
  isn't installed on the system.


Why isn't the module defined when using the **screen** program?

  The screen program starts a non-login interactive shell.  The Bash
  shell startup doesn't start sourcing /etc/profile and therefore the
  ``/etc/profile.d/*.sh`` scripts for non-login interactive shells.  You
  can patch bash and fix ``/etc/bashrc`` (see :ref:`issues-with-bash`
  for a solution) or  you can fix your ``~/.bashrc`` to source
  ``/etc/profile.d/*.sh``

  You may be better off using **tmux** instead. It starts a login shell.

Why does ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` get cleared when using the **screen** program?

  The screen program is a guid program.  That means it runs as the group
  of the program and not the group associated with the user.  For
  security reason all of these kinds of program clear
  ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.  This unsetting of ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` is done
  by the Unix operating system and not Lmod.

  You may be better off using **tmux** instead. It is a regular
  program.

How can you write TCL files that can be safely used with both Lmod
and Tmod?

  For example the hide-version command only works Lmod and could be
  found in ~/.modulerc.  This could be read by both Tmod and Lmod.
  You can prevent Tmod from executing Lmod only code in the following way::

    #%Module
    global env
    if { [info exists env(LMOD_VERSION_MAJOR)]} {
       hide-version CUDA/8.8.8
    }

  Lmod defines the environment variable LMOD_VERSION_MAJOR during its
  execution.  This trick can also be used in a TCL modulefile to set
  the family function::

    #%Module
    ...
    global env
    if { [info exists env(LMOD_VERSION_MAJOR)]} {
       family compiler
    }

How can I get the shell functions created by modules in bash shell
scripts such as job submission scripts?

   First, please make sure that shell functions and alias works
   correctly in bash interactive sub-shells.  If they don't then your
   site is not setup correctly.

   Once that works then change the first line of the shell script to
   be:

       #!/bin/bash -l

   Note that is a minus ell not minus one. This will cause the startup
   scripts to be sourced before the first executable statement in the
   script.

Why do modules get sometimes get loaded when I execute ``module use <path>``?

   A main principal is that when $MODULEPATH changes, Lmod checks all
   the currently loaded modules. If any of thoses modules would not
   have been chosen then each is swapped for the new choice.

How to use module commands inside a Makefile?

   A user might wish to use module commands inside a Makefile.  Here is a
   generic way that would work with both Tmod and Lmod.  Both Lmod and
   Tmod define MODULESHOME to point to the top of the module install
   directory and both tools use the same initialization method to
   define the module command. 

   Here is an example Makefile that shows a user listing their currently
   loaded modules::


      module_list:
             source $$MODULESHOME/init/bash; module list
